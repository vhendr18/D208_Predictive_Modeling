It is fast when compared with other possible programming languages like R or MATLAB (Massaron, p. 8).\n",

    "Multiple regression is an appropriate technique to analyze the research question because our target variable, predicting a real number of GBs per year, is a continuous variable (how much data is used).  Also, perhaps there are several (versus simply one) explanatory variables (area type, job, children, age, income, etc.) that will add to our understanding when trying to predict how much data a customer will use in a given year.  When adding or removing independent variables from our regression equation, we will find out whether or not they have a positive or negative relationship to our target variable & how that might affect company decisions on marketing segmentation."
