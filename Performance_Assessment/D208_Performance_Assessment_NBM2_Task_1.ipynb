Also, perhaps there are several (versus simply one) explanatory variables (area type, job, children, age, income, etc.) that will add to our understanding when trying to predict how much data a customer will use in a given year.  When adding or removing independent variables from our regression equation, we will find out whether or not they have a positive or negative relationship to our target variable & how that might affect company decisions on marketing segmentation."
